# Indian Sign Language Detection using CNN 🤟

## About the Project
**Indian Sign Language Detection using CNN** is a deep learning-based system designed to recognize and classify Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures in real-time. The project aims to improve accessibility for the hearing-impaired by leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **OpenCV** for live gesture detection.

## Features
- 🖐 **Real-Time Gesture Recognition** – Detects and classifies ISL hand signs.
- 🎥 **Live Video Processing** – Uses OpenCV to capture and analyze hand gestures.
- 📊 **Deep Learning Model** – CNN-based model trained for high accuracy.
- 🚀 **High Accuracy Classification** – Robust detection with minimal errors.
- 🔄 **Scalable & Extendable** – Can be adapted for additional gestures or languages.

## Tech Stack
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Dataset:** Hand gesture images for ISL
- **Model Architecture:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x installed
- Required dependencies:
  ```sh
  pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy matplotlib
  ```

### Steps to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/isl-cnn.git
   cd isl-cnn
   ```
2. Train the model (if not pre-trained):
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```
3. Run real-time gesture detection:
   ```sh
   python detect_gestures.py
   ```

## Dataset
The model is trained on a dataset of hand gestures representing Indian Sign Language. You can expand it by adding more labeled images.

## Future Enhancements
- 🏗️ Expand dataset to include more gestures.
- 🎭 Improve background noise filtering for better accuracy.
- 📱 Deploy as a mobile/web application.
